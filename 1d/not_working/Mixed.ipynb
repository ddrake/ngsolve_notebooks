    "From Arnold: For some problems, such as the Stokes problem, primal-based methods are impractical.  For such problems the mixed methods are the simplest and most direct alternative and are widely used.  For the other examples, however, the most basic methods are primal-based.  A commonly stated reason to prefer mixed methods in these cases is that the dual variable (stress or elasticity, flux for thermal problems, moments for plate bending) is often the variable\n",
    "of most interest.  For primal-based methods this variable is not a fundamental unknown and must be obtained a posteriori by differentiation, which entails a loss of accuracy.  For the mixed methods, however, the dual variable is computed as a fundamental unknown. Of course, this argument is only heuristic.  Its correctness depends on the available mixed finite  element  spaces  and  primal  finite  element  spaces,  the  accuracy  they  offer,  and  the computational work they require to solve the corresponding discrete problems. Another  common  motivation  for  the  use  of  mixed  methods  is  the  avoidance  of $C^1$ elements for plate bending and other fourth order problems.  This is because the mixed functional for plate bending involves no more than two derivatives in any term and hence, after a suitable integration by parts, may be evaluated on finite element spaces with merely continuous elements.  The primal variational functional, however, requires the use of $C^1$ elements (or non-conforming elements).\n",

    "If $\\lambda = 1$, to satisfy the boundary condition, the value of $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} \\equiv \\nabla u \\cdot n$ on the left boundary must equal $y(1-y)$.  This function is zero at $y=0$ and $y=1$ with max value $1/4$ at $y = 1/2$.  We can see that the solution is reasonable since at the bottom left, the magnitude of the gradient is large, but its direction is vertically upward.  At the top left, the direction of the gradient is outward, but its magnitude approaches zero.  On the top and right edges, we see also that the normal derivative is zero.\n",

    "It's interesting that changing lambda doesn't affect the character of the solution at all, it only scales u.  The larger the value of $\\lambda$, the 'flatter' the solution.  For example, if $\\lambda = 10$, the min and max values of u are $5$ and $5.04$, if $\\lambda = 0.1$, the min and max values of $u$ are $5.1$ and $9.2$ and if $\\lambda = .001$, the min and max values of $u$ are $22$ and $430$.
